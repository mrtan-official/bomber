# Mr Tan Auto Message Bomber Tool

> **Warning:** This tool can repeatedly type and send the same message. It can easily be abused for spamming or other unauthorized actions. This project is intended **only** for educational, testing, and authorized-use scenarios. Do not run it against other people's systems or services without explicit permission.

## Brief Description

**Mr Tan Auto Message Bomber Tool** is a Windows-based Python script that:

- Generates a unique device key from the system username and MAC address.
- Checks remote server status and block list (via raw GitHub URLs).
- Sends the device key to an admin via a Telegram bot.
- Takes a user message and a sending limit, then simulates keyboard input to type the message and press `Enter` repeatedly.

> Note: The tool uses `pyautogui` (keyboard emulation) so it types to the **active window** where the cursor is focused.

## Converting to .exe (recommended method)

This tool **can** be converted to an `.exe` that runs on Windows without Python installed. See the conversion section below for detailed steps.

---

## Security & Best Practices

* **Never** hardcode secret tokens (Telegram bot token) or admin IDs in plain text for distributed `.exe`. Use environment variables or external config encrypted at runtime.
* Test thoroughly in an isolated environment.
* Be aware some antivirus engines may flag auto-typing and remote-communication tools as suspicious â€” sign your binary if needed for distribution.
